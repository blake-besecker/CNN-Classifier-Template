To create your own model, simply import whatever image data you have into the local repository and give it a folder structure like this:
-data
  -class1
    -image.jpg
    -image2.jpg
  -class2
    -image3.jpg
  etc...
I have included a pretrained model you can also load and try out yourself. It classfies anime based off an image given, using this dataset:
